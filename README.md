## Raspberry Pi Live Cam

![My Pi!](https://github.com/healeycodes/Raspberry-Pi-Live-Cam/blob/master/my-pi-320.png)

This repository hosts all the files for my tutorial on building a live cam with your Raspberry Pi.

The web app is built with Flask and the Raspberry Pi script is written in Python using the `picamera` module.

### Install

Edit the `url` variable in `camera.py` to your Flask app's address/port.
